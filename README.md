# Plastic SCM integration with VS Code's SCM features

## Intro

[`plastic-scm`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=plastic-scm.plastic-scm)
is a Visual Studio Code extension that integrates [Plastic SCM](https://www.plasticscm.com/).
With this plugin, you can use Plastic SCM as your SCM tool. It is powered by

We're working to add more! üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüë®‚Äçüè≠

Have a look at the [list of issues on Github](https://github.com/PlasticSCM/vscode-plasticscm/issues).

### Checkin

You can type in the input field in the SCM view and hit `Ctrl+Enter` to checkin
**all your pending changes**. We don't support selecting what items you want to
check in at the moment.

You can also invoke the Checkin command using the Command Palette. You'll be
prompted to enter a commit message in that case.

### File Changes

When editing a tracked text file, you'll see VS Code show inline gutter color indicators to show lines added, changed, or removed, similar to using Git or other source control extensions. You can also open the Source Control panel to and click on any modified text file to open a full-file diff from the latest changeset.
